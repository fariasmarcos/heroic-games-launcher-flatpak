  <description>
    <p>Heroic is a native GUI alternative to the Epic Games Launcher for Linux, Windows and MacOS. 
    It is open source under GPLv3 and is maintained by a community of developers that works for FREE on their FREE TIME. 
    Heroic for now is just a GUI for Legendary, which is a CLI tool that deals with the login, download and launch the games. 
    Support for other stores is planned in the future.</p>
